# Mars-Webscrape-Project
This was my submission for the Monash Universities data anaylitics bootcamp. Contained within is both parts of the mars data project and the .csv output from Data_analysis.ipynb. Article_grabber.ipynb uses splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape the titles and article previews from https://redplanetscience.com/ and contains them within a list of dictionaries for each article. Data_analysis.ipynb uses pandas to read an html https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html and make it into a dtat frame, where the data is analyzed by answering 4 questions out of the 5 provided. It then exports the data frame as a csv as mars_data.csv.
