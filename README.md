# mars_data_challenge
This is my submission for unit 12s web scraping challenge. Contained within is both parts of the mars data challenge and the .csv output from part 2. Part 1 uses splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape the titles and article previews from https://redplanetscience.com/ and contains them within a list of dictionaries for each article. Part 2 uses pandas to read an html https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html and make it into a dtat frame, where the data is analyzed by answering 4 questions out of the 5 provided. It then exports the data frame as a csv as mars_data.csv.
